PHP nbtscan
===========
nbtscan is a well known program, but is a binary and must be installed on systems. Our implementation is more basic, but allows you to query the nbt name of a Windows system purely with PHP.


Usage
------------
        $nbtscan = new nbtscan();
        $name = $nbtscan->scan('192.168.0.1');
